You've completed your first Bitnami course!

In this scenario you learned how to connect to your application server and perform the most common tasks. Let's review the steps you have followed and what you learned in each of them:

* **Finding application credentials:** By checking the *bitnami_credentials* file, you have obtained the required credentials to access your application. You have also learned how to access to the WordPress admin panel and how to log in to the application.
* **Stopping and restarting the services:** In this step you have learned how to use the `/opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh` script to manage your application services.
* **Editing files using `nano`:** Sometimes you will need to edito some of the application files to, for example, set a custom domain. Nano is a good resource for editing files and now, you know how to use it.
* **Exploring Bitnami files and directories:** Bitnami configures the `/opt/bitnami` directory in which you can find all the files related to databases, servers, or network configuration. Knowing where is each file is the fiest step for customizing your application. You have also learned in this step, the importance of having the right permissions to edit sensitive files.
* **Removing the Bitnami badge:** Although this banner is really useful at the beginning, once you want to get into production, it is time to remove it. Remember, it only takes few minutes and the "magic" command you have learned in this step.
* **Connecting to the database:** In this step you learned two things, connecting to the database and finding the database credentials. Are you able to say now where can you find them?
* **Running the Bitnami Support Tool:** Chances are that while you use your application, you add new features, change some default values, or customize its user interface. And due to all these changes, sometimes, issues come up. Bitnami offers you the possibility of contacting a support agent to help you solve your problems. The Bitnami Support tool allows you to collect the necessary information to debug your application in case that something went wrong.

Now that you have basic knowledge about Bitnami images it is a good moment to try to go further.
