Welcome to your first Bitnami course!

In this tutorial, you will learn, step by step, how to start with a Bitnami image. This course uses the Bitnami WordPress image as an example, but these concepts are generally applicable to most of the Bitnami applications. You will walk through some important first steps, such as finding your WordPress credentials, connect to the application through SSH, or removing the Bitnami badge.

# Assumptions and prerequisites

This guide makes some assumptions that you need to know in order to follow the instructions shown in this course. These assumptions are:

* You have a WordPress image running in either in an instance of the cloud provider of your choice. Check the [deployment offering](https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/cloud) to quick deploy the application on the cloud.
* You have the public IP address of your application at hand.
* You have an SSH key pair.

This course starts at the moment that you already have accomplished the above assumptions.
