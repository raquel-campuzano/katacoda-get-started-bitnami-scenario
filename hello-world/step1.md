This first step shows you how to retrieve the credentials to log in to the application. 

This step is very important since **the password you will obtain in this step, allows you not only to access your application administrator panel but also to connect to the database.**

1. To find the application credentials run the following command:

   `cat ./bitnami_credentials`{{execute}}

2. Click the "Access application" tab located beside the terminal tab. It redirects you to the WordPress blog.

Scroll down until you see the "Log in" link. Click on it and **access the WordPress dashboard using the credentials you have obtained in the previous step.**
