This first step shows you how to retrieve the credentials to log in to the application. 

This step is very important since **the password you will obtain in this step, allows you not only to access your application administrator panel but also to connect to the database.**

1. To find the application credentials run the following command:

`cat ./bitnami_credentials`{{execute}}

2. Click the "Access application" tab you'll find beside the terminal tab. It redirects you to WordPress. Scroll down until you see the "Log in" link. Click on it and access WordPress using the credentials you have obtained in the previous step.
